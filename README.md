Artificial neural networks for kids
============================================

“This book is for both ‘kids’, and experts! (This feat was not easy to pull off)

This short book contains what is probably the easiest, most intuitive fun tutorial of how to describe an artificial neural network from scratch. (This short book is a clever and enjoyable yet detailed guide, that doesn't "dumb down" the neural network literature)

This short book is a chance to understand the whole structure of an elementary, but powerful artificial neural network, just as well as you understand how to write your name.”

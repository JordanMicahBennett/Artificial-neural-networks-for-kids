ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORKS FOR KIDS
============================================

This short book contains what is probably the easiest, most intuitive fun tutorial of how to describe an artificial neural network from scratch. (This short book is a clever and enjoyable yet detailed guide, that doesn't "dumb down" the neural network literature)

This short book is a chance to understand the whole structure of an elementary, but powerful artificial neural network, just as well as you understand how to write your name.‚Äù
